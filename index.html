It has a lot of fun rides including roller coasters, carasouls, water rides, etc. My favourite was the grizzly bear mine ride. If you're going there, don't forget to see the parade. All disney charecters are there. Remember to get there early as it gets really crowded. I would reccomend getting there by the Dineyland express.</p>

                <p>Harry Potter books are very good but to have a movie on them is even better. ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" is a red-blooded adventure movie, dripping with atmosphere, filled with the gruesome and the sublime, and surprisingly faithful to the novel. A lot of things could have gone wrong, and none of them have: Chris Columbus' movie is an enchanting classic that does full justice to a story that was a daunting challenge. The novel by J.K. Rowling was muscular and vivid, and the danger was that the movie would make things too cute and cuddly. It doesn't. Like an "Indiana Jones" for younger viewers, it tells a rip-roaring tale of supernatural adventure, where colorful and eccentric characters alternate with scary stuff like a three-headed dog, a pit of tendrils known as the Devil's Snare and a two-faced immortal who drinks unicorn blood. Scary, yes, but not too scary--just scary enough.</p>

                    Pennsylvania creates largest government solar commitment in the U.S.

                    Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf announced a new renewable energy initiative that is the largest solar commitment by any U.S. governing entity. All told, this initiative will supply nearly 50 percent of the state government’s electricity through seven new solar arrays located in Pennsylvania’s Columbia, Juniata, Montour, Northumberland, Snyder and York counties. When the project is completed in early 2023, it is expected to deliver 361,000 megawatts of electricity each year and reduce climate-triggering carbon pollution by nearly 158,000 metric tons annually.

                    “Going solar is a triple win for Pennsylvania: It’s good for our planet, good for our health, and good for our pocketbooks,” PennEnvironment Executive Director David Masur said. “Harnessing more of the sun’s energy means cleaner air, a more stable climate, more resilient communities and an energy source we can depend on that’s virtually pollution-free. This is a keystone solar policy for the renewable energy future in the Keystone State. Smart public policy decisions like this one have been the key drivers of the incredible growth we’ve seen in solar power across the nation.”

                    EPA relaunches climate science and policy website

                    The Environmental Protection Agency’s website has returned to a focus on climate science and policy. Under the previous administration, this type of information was removed from the site. The relaunch serves as a strong signal that the Biden administration will restore the role of science in protecting our communities and public health.

                    “By empowering Americans with the best scientific evidence available, the Environmental Protection Agency is providing a critical service that aligns squarely with its mission to protect our environment and public health,” said Andrea McGimsey, senior director for Environment America’s Global Warming Solutions campaign. “Only when we’re armed with the facts about what we face now and in the coming years -- and have information on what we can do to make a difference on climate change -- can we make the best decisions possible to protect the vibrancy of our communities and a stable future for our children and grandchildren.

                    Virginia moves toward single-use plastics phase out

                    Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced a key order in addressing plastic pollution. Executive Order 77 eliminates disposable plastic bags and single-use foodware at all state agencies within 120 days, and phases out a wider range of single-use plastics in the state agencies and public universities by 2025. It also directs the state government to develop solid waste reduction and landfill diversion recommendations. The order builds on Virginia’s plastic reduction leadership after Gov. Northam approved a ban on polystyrene foam cups and take-out containers. Localities are now able to establish a plastic bag fee.

                    “Whether single-use plastic ends up in a landfill, an incinerator or in our environment, the waste it creates for just a few minutes of convenience will have long-term consequences for our communities and the environment lasting far into the future,” U.S. PIRG Zero Waste Program Director Alex Truelove said. “By eliminating the worst forms of single-use plastic and taking the first step toward a future with less waste, Gov. Northam truly is setting a strong example for other states to follow.”

                    What else we’re celebrating:

                    Bald eagle numbers soaring: Once teetering on the brink of extinction, the bald eagle population in the lower 48 states has quadrupled since 2009. The news has been hailed as a “historic conservation success story” by U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland.

                    Report marks offshore wind’s immense potential: A new report by Environment America Research and Policy Center and Frontier Group found that offshore wind could deliver 90 percent of America’s projected 2050 electricity demand.

                    Baby right whale boom: In the 2021 North Atlantic right whale calving season, 17 live calves have been spotted by researchers, which is nearly as many observed in the last four calving seasons combined. Each birth is closely monitored as fewer than 400 whales remain in the total population.

                    THE asteroid impact that wiped out dinosaurs from Earth also gave birth to the Amazon rainforest, says a new study. In an analysis of thousands of fossil pollen and leaves, the researchers found that the cataclysmic asteroid impact that resulted in the destruction of nearly 75 per cent of all terrestrial life on Earth drastically restructured tropical forests. It set the stage for the evolution of what has become one of the planet’s most diverse ecosystems -- the neotropical rainforest, according to the study published in the journal Science.

                    While the end-Cretaceous impact nearly 66 million years ago was catastrophic for terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, its long-term effects on tropical forests have remained a mystery. This is largely due to the lack of palaeobotanical exploration in the region, which has only just begun to provide the data needed to evaluate these questions. For the study, Monica Carvalho from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institution in Panama, and colleagues used fossil pollen and leaves recovered from Colombia to characterise how the impact changed South American tropical forests, finding large-scale changes in species composition and forest structure.

                    According to the findings, late Cretaceous rainforests were characterised by an open canopy environment. However, plant diversity declined by roughly 45 per cent at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary and extinctions were widespread, particularly among seed-bearing plants. While the forests recovered over the subsequent six million years, angiosperms, or flowering plants, came to dominate the forests, said the study.

                <h4>Global warming already responsible for one in three heat-related deaths</h4> <img src="global-warming-burning-earth-burning.jpeg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
                    Between 1991 and 2018, more than a third of all deaths in which heat played a role were attributable to human-induced global warming, according to a new article in Nature Climate Change.

                    The study, the largest of its kind, was led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the University of Bern within the Multi-Country Multi-City (MCC) Collaborative Research Network. Using data from 732 locations in 43 countries around the world it shows for the first time the actual contribution of human-made climate change in increasing mortality risks due to heat.

                    Overall, the estimates show that 37% of all heat-related deaths in the recent summer periods were attributable to the warming of the planet due to anthropogenic activities. This percentage of heat-related deaths attributed to human-induced climate change was highest in Central and South America (up to 76% in Ecuador or Colombia, for example) and South-East Asia (between 48% to 61%).

                    Estimates also show the number of deaths from human-induced climate change that occurred in specific cities; 136 additional deaths per year in Santiago de Chile (44.3% of total heat-related deaths in the city), 189 in Athens (26.1%), 172 in Rome (32%), 156 in Tokyo (35.6%), 177 in Madrid (31.9%), 146 in Bangkok (53.4%), 82 in London (33.6%), 141 in New York (44.2%), and 137 in Ho Chi Minh City (48.5%). The authors say their findings are further evidence of the need to adopt strong mitigation policies to reduce future warming, and to implement interventions to protect populations from the adverse consequences of heat exposure.

                    Dr Ana M. Vicedo-Cabrera, from the University of Bern and first author of the study, said: "We expect the proportion of heat-related deaths to continue to grow if we don't do something about climate change or adapt. So far, the average global temperature has only increased by about 1°C, which is a fraction of what we could face if emissions continue to grow unchecked."

                    Global warming is affecting our health in several ways, from direct impacts linked to wildfires and extreme weather, to changes in the spread of vector-borne diseases, among others. Perhaps most strikingly is the increase in mortality and morbidity associated with heat. Scenarios of future climate conditions predict a substantial rise in average temperatures, with extreme events such as heatwaves leading to future increases in the related health burden. However, no research has been conducted into what extent these impacts have already occurred in recent decades until now.

                    This new study focused on human-made global warming through a 'detection and attribution' study that identifies and attributes observed phenomena to changes in climate and weather. Specifically, the team examined past weather conditions simulated under scenarios with and without anthropogenic emissions. This enabled the researchers to separate the warming and related health impact linked with human activities from natural trends. Heat-related mortality was defined as the number of deaths attributed to heat, occurring at exposures higher than the optimum temperature for human health, which varies across locations.

                    While on average over a third of heat-related deaths are due to human-induced climate change, impact varies substantially across regions. Climate-related heat casualties range from a few dozen to several hundred deaths each year per city, as shown above, depending on the local changes in climate in each area and the vulnerability of its population. Interestingly, populations living in low and middle-income countries, which were responsible for a minor part of anthropogenic emissions in the past, are those most affected.

                    In the UK, 35% of heat-related deaths could be attributed to human-induced climate change, which corresponds to approximately 82 deaths in London, 16 deaths in Manchester, 20 in West Midlands or 4 in Bristol and Liverpool every summer season.

                    Professor Antonio Gasparrini from LSHTM, senior author of the study and coordinator of the MCC Network, said: "This is the largest detection and attribution study on current health risks of climate change. The message is clear: climate change will not just have devastating impacts in the future, but every continent is already experiencing the dire consequences of human activities on our planet. We must act now."

                    The authors acknowledge limitations of the study including being unable to include locations in all world regions -- for example, large parts of Africa and South Asia -- due to a lack of empirical data.

Frank Bryce, now an elderly man, wakes in the night to see a light in the window of the abandoned Riddle House. He investigates and overhears Voldemort and Wormtail plotting to kill a boy named Harry Potter. Voldemort takes note of him and kills him on the spot. Harry Potter wakes up in the night with a throbbing pain in the scar Voldemort gave him. He worries that Voldemort is nearby, and he writes to Sirius Black, his godfather, mentioning the pain in his scar.

                            The next morning Harry's Uncle Vernon receives a letter from the Weasleys asking Harry to join them at the Quidditch World Cup, and Vernon grudgingly agrees to let Harry go. The following day, the Weasleys arrive in the Dursleys' boarded-up fireplace to pick up Harry. The Weasley twins "accidentally" leave a trick toffee on the ground, which Dudley eats, causing his tongue to engorge itself. The Dursleys panic and throw things at Mr. Weasley as the Weasley boys and Harry exit through the fireplace. Harry arrives at The Burrow, the Weasley household, and there he meets for the two eldest Weasley brothers, Bill and Charlie, and there, Mrs. Weasley berates the twins for making Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and giving them to Dudley.<br>

                        <p class="p_modal">King Fred is the ruler of a kingdom called Cornucopia. Life in Cornucopia is wonderful for most of the inhabitants, except for those who live near the Marshlands. The people who live near the Marshlands are very poor, and they tell tales of a monster called the Ickabog that lives in the marsh and eats sheep and perhaps people. King Fred has two friends, Lord Spittleworth and Lord Flapoon, who use flattery to get the king to do what they want. Two families live near one another in Cornucopia: the Dovetails and the Beamishes. The parents in both families work for the king: Mrs. Dovetail is a seamstress, Mr. Dovetail a carpenter, Mrs. Beamish a pastry chef, and Major Beamish the head of the Royal Guard. The children in the two families, Daisy and Bert, are best friends until a tragedy occurs. Mrs. Dovetail dies from being overworked by the king, which leads Daisy to publicly insult the king. Bert and Daisy fight about this and their friendship seems to be over.

                            King Fred is very concerned about being popular and respected, so he decides he will do something that will go down in history. When a man from the Marshlands asks the king to punish the Ickabog for stealing his dog, the king decides to take the Royal Guard and hunt down the Ickabog. When they get into the marsh, a thick fog surrounds them. King Fred believes he has seen the Ickabog and becomes terrified. He sends Lord Spittleworth and Lord Flapoon into the fog, and Lord Flapoon accidentally shoots Major Beamish. Lord Spittleworth, Lord Flapoon, and Major Roach (who is promoted due to Major Beamish's death) decide to pretend that the Ickabog killed Major Beamish. The King and his party return to the palace with fear and sadness.

                            Upon returning to the palace, King Fred retreats to his chambers and Lord Spittleworth more or less takes control of Cornucopia. He spreads the idea that the Ickabog exists and says that anyone who challenges this belief is a traitor. He also institutes an Ickabog tax that he says will pay for an Ickabog Defense Force to guard the Marshlands, but he actually steals most of the money for himself. To scare people into believing the Ickabog tax is necessary, Lord Spittleworth puts together a group of soldiers called the Dark Footers to fake Ickabog attacks. They do this with four giant wooden feet carved by Mr. Dovetail, who is kidnapped and put in the dungeon to carve them. Meanwhile, Mr. Dovetail's daughter Daisy is kidnapped and taken to an orphanage far from her father which is run by a drunk, uncaring woman.


                            The people of Cornucopia grow poorer and poorer due to the Ickabog tax, and discontent begins to build. Bert and his mother Mrs. Beamish realize what is going on with the wooden Ickabog feet and Mrs. Beamish attempts to confront the king. Mrs. Beamish is put into the dungeon, and Bert must run away. Bert and Roderick Roach, the son of Major Roach, end up in the same orphanage as Daisy.

                            Daisy, Bert, Roderick, and a girl from the Marshlands named Martha attempt to escape the orphanage. They nearly die due to a winter storm, but they are saved by the Ickabog. The Ickabog takes them to its cave and tells them it is the only Ickabog in existence. The Ickabog believes it must have children and teach them to kill humans for Ickabogs to continue existing. Daisy convinces the Ickabog to show the people of Cornucopia that it is good and does not kill humans. That way, the Ickabog's babies will be born coexisting peacefully with people. The Ickabog agrees and the children and the Ickabog march through Cornucopia showing people not to fear Ickabogs and informing people of Lord Spittleworth's lies.

                            The people of Cornucopia march with the Ickabog to the palace to confront King Fred and Lord Spittleworth. At the same time, the prisoners in the palace dungeon escape and take over the palace. King Fred is held hostage at the palace, and Bert and Roderick catch Lord Spittleworth trying to run away. King Fred, Lord Spittleworth, and others are put in jail, and Cornucopia returns to being a happy kingdom. In fact, it is even more happy and peaceful than the beginning of the story, because Ickabogs and people live together and the people of the Marshlands are no longer impoverished.
